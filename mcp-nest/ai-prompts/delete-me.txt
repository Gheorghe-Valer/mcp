great. let's continue with the creation of the workflow in n8n. the n8n is under n8n.open-hand.org and the MCP server unde the nest.open-hand.org/mcp. the AI       
  it will be gemini. the idea is to trigger from the sapui5 this workflow and to send it to the AI that will use the tools. final idea to be able to invoke OData     
   calls interpreting the metadata with this tools

● Perfect! Let's create the n8n workflow that integrates Gemini AI with your MCP server for intelligent OData operations.

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Design n8n workflow architecture
     ☐ Create n8n workflow JSON
     ☐ Set up Gemini AI integration
     ☐ Test workflow with MCP tools

● N8N Workflow Architecture

  Flow: SAPUI5 Chat → n8n Webhook → Gemini AI → MCP Tools → Response

  Key Components:
  1. Webhook Trigger: Receives requests from SAPUI5 app
  2. Session Manager: Handles MCP session initialization
  3. Gemini AI Node: Interprets user queries and decides which tools to use
  4. MCP Tool Nodes: Execute SAP OData operations
  5. Response Formatter: Formats results for SAPUI5

  ⎿  ☒ Design n8n workflow architecture
     ☒ Create n8n workflow JSON
     ☐ Set up Gemini AI integration
     ☐ Test workflow with MCP tools

● 🚀 N8N Workflow Created!

  Workflow Features:

  1. Webhook Endpoint: https://n8n.open-hand.org/webhook/sap-chat
  2. Intelligent Query Processing: Gemini AI interprets user requests
  3. MCP Integration: Connects to your SAP OData MCP server
  4. Automatic Service Discovery: Discovers available SAP services
  5. Metadata Analysis: Retrieves and explains service metadata
  6. Conversational Responses: User-friendly explanations

  Workflow Flow:

  SAPUI5 → Webhook → Process Input → Initialize MCP Session →
  Get Session ID → Connect SAP → Get Services →
  Gemini AI Analysis → Route Action →
  (Get Metadata OR General Help) → Format Response → SAPUI5

  📋 Setup Instructions:

  1. Import to n8n:

  1. Go to https://n8n.open-hand.org
  2. Click "Import" → "From File"
  3. Upload the n8n-workflow.json file
  4. Save and activate the workflow

  2. Configure Gemini AI:

  You'll need to add your Google Gemini API key to the Gemini nodes:
  1. Edit each "Gemini AI" node in the workflow
  2. Add your API key in the credentials section
  3. Test the connection

  3. Test the Workflow:

  Webhook URL: https://n8n.open-hand.org/webhook/sap-chat

  Test Request (POST):
  {
    "query": "What purchase order data is available?",
    "userId": "test-user"
  }

  Expected Response:
  {
    "success": true,
    "message": "I can help you with purchase order data! Based on the available SAP services, you have access to the API_PURCHASEORDER_PROCESS_SRV service...",       
    "type": "ai_response",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
    "sessionId": "abc123..."
  }

  4. SAPUI5 Integration:

  Your SAPUI5 app should make POST requests to the webhook with this structure:

  // In your SAPUI5 chat controller
  sendMessage: function(sMessage) {
      fetch('https://n8n.open-hand.org/webhook/sap-chat', {
          method: 'POST',
          headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
          body: JSON.stringify({
              query: sMessage,
              userId: this.getCurrentUserId(),
              sessionId: this.getSessionId() // Optional
          })
      })
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => {
          this.displayResponse(data.message);
      });
  }

     ☐ Test workflow with MCP tools

● 🎯 Next Steps:

  1. Import the workflow to your n8n instance
  2. Add Gemini API credentials
  3. Test the webhook endpoint
  4. Create the SAPUI5 chat application

  The workflow is designed to handle natural language queries like:
  - "Show me purchase order data"
  - "What business partner information is available?"
  - "Get metadata for sales orders"
  - "What SAP services can I access?"
